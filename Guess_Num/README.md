Welcome to Guess a Number!!

This little game functions as follows:

* You can either be the guesser [1] or the one who picked the number to be guessed [2].
* If you are the guesser, the script will ask you to guess a number between 1 and 25. If the guess is too low or too high, you'll be prompted to try again! You have 3 chances to guess the correct number.
* If you want to pick the number, you'll be prompted to enter the maximum number. Then, the scrpit will try to guess which number you picked, with 9 tries. You can either tell it if the number you picked is lesser then [L], higher than [H] or if it's the correct number [C].
* The game ends if either you or the script guess correctly or your chances run out.
